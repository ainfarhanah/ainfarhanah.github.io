        <p>Hey, I’m Hana — I have a background in Big Data Technologies and a passion for turning messy data into meaningful insights. I’ve worked on everything from cleaning datasets to building dashboards, and I’m always learning something new along the way. Right now, I’m in network operations, but I’m gradually making my way back into data — building my portfolio, refreshing my skills, and working on projects that blend curiosity with creativity.</p>

            <h4>PHP PDO CRUD System</h4>
            <p>The MyTecc System is a simple web application developed as part of my university assignment for the Web Technology & Application course. It was built using PHP (with PDO for secure database access), MySQL, HTML, and Bootstrap.

The system performs basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on data stored in a MySQL database. It features a clean, responsive user interface designed with Bootstrap and demonstrates the use of PHP Data Objects (PDO) to ensure secure and efficient communication with the database.</p>

            <h4>Python-Flask: Data Cleaning and Merging Application </h4>
            <p>This project is a web-based application developed during my software engineering internship to automate the cleaning and merging of Excel files with inconsistent structures. It was designed to support the GIS team by reducing time-consuming manual processing of data exported from various sources.

Built with Flask (Python), Pandas, HTML, and Bootstrap, the app allows users to upload multiple Excel files, automatically detects differences in column structures, cleans and merges the data, and generates a downloadable consolidated output file.</p>
