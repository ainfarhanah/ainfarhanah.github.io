        <p>Hey, I’m Hana — I have a background in Big Data Technologies and a love for making sense of messy data. I’ve worked on everything from cleaning up datasets to building dashboards, and I’m always picking up something new along the way.

            Right now, I’m in network operations, but I’m gradually making my way back into data — building my portfolio, refreshing my skills, and working on projects that mix curiosity and creativity.</p>
