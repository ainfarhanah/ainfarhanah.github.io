        <p>Hey, I’m Hana — I have a background in Big Data Technologies and a passion for turning messy data into meaningful insights. I’ve worked on everything from cleaning datasets to building dashboards, and I’m always learning something new along the way. Right now, I’m in network operations, but I’m gradually making my way back into data — building my portfolio, refreshing my skills, and working on projects that blend curiosity with creativity.</p>
